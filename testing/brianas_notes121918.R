#git is a software
#GItHub is a web based host for git related items
#they are not the same

#download vs. clone - not the same, cloning allows the git software to keep an eye on it

#Rproj files are useful for sharing


#commit your file and updates to your local (origin) directory which is watched by the git software,
# then push to the master branch -- may have to pull first if there has been updates from a collaborator
